Distributed notification watcher
================================

A tiny program that listens to Mac OS X distributed notifications and dumps them to standard output.


Compiling and installing
------------------------

You need the Developer Tools installed on your Mac.

Then just type `make`.

Copy the resulting notification_watcher to your favorite `bin/` directory.


Usage
-----

Pass the name of the notification you are interested on.

    notification_watcher NAME

For example, to see iTunes notifications, try:

    notification_watcher com.apple.iTunes.playerInfo

and then start/stop iTunes music.


Output layout
-------------

The output layout is written in such a way to make parsing easy.

The format is:

 * a string of digits, represents the size of the payload;
 * a newline character (\n);
 * the notification payload;
 * a newline character (\n);

Future
------

Currently, the output format is a old-style NextStep plist.

I'm planning on adding support for NSPropertyListSerialization and allow XML output.
